                rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases
                to
                process your personal information:
                Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your

                defend
                our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.

                Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations
                of,
                any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to
                another
                company.
                Affiliates. We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will require those

                privacy
                notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>

            <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out
                in this
                privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
                accounting,
                or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal
                information
                for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>

            <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either
                delete
                or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal
                information
                has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate
                it
                from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

            <h3 id="6">6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h3>

            <p>In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>

                Services,
                you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and
                consent to
                such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than
                18
                years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
                delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children
                under
                age 18, please contact us at join@alexanderriedel.de.</p>

                by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below
                or
                updating your preferences.</p>

            <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal
                nor,
                will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing
                grounds other than consent.</p>

            <p>Account Information</p>

            <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your

                problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal
                requirements.

            <h3 id="8">8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>

            <p>
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
                ("DNT")
                feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
                browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for
                recognizing
                and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
                signals
                or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
                standard
                for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice
                in
                a revised version of this privacy notice.
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
                We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated
                "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make
                material
                changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes
                or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to
                be
                informed of how we are protecting your information.
